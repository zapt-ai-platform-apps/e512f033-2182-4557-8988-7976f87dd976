# Create a 3D Character

This journey guides the user through generating a 3D character model with rigging and animations from a text description.

## Steps

1. **Enter Character Description**

   - On the main page, you will see a text input field labeled "Describe your character".
   - Enter a detailed description of the character you want to create (e.g., "A medieval knight in full armor with a sword and shield").

2. **Generate Character**

   - Click the "Generate Character" button.
   - The app will process your request and display a loading indicator.

3. **Review Generation Results**

   - Once the character is generated, the app will display a message indicating your character is ready.

4. **Download Character and Animations**

   - Click the "Download Character" button to download the 3D model file.
   - Click the "Download Animations" button to download the animations.

5. **Additional Actions**

   - You can modify your description and generate new characters as desired.

## Important Information

- Ensure you have a stable internet connection as the generation process requires communication with the external API.
- The downloads will be in standard 3D model formats (e.g., FBX, glTF).
- If any errors occur during the generation process, an error message will be displayed.
